📘 Data Structure Lab

Welcome to Data Structure Lab! 🚀
This repository is a collection of C++ programs where I experiment with pointers, function pointers, and their role in building fundamental data structures.

The aim is not only to write code but also to understand how memory is managed under the hood, and how pointers give us direct control over it.

✨ Features

🔹 Implementation of core data structures using pointers

🔹 Hands-on use of function pointers for flexibility

🔹 Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly C++ code

🔹 Focus on memory management and efficiency

📂 What’s Inside

✅ Pointer basics (declaring, initializing, dereferencing)

✅ Function pointers in action

✅ Data structure implementations (step by step)

✅ Lab exercises for practice

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts: Pointers, Function Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation

📖 Why This Repo?

Pointers are the soul of C++.
By working with them directly, you get a deeper understanding of how data structures work in memory. This lab is my journey to mastering them and hopefully a useful guide for you too!
